    "\n",
    "The dataset we will use for this problems is the Electronics subset of the Amazon Reviews dataset. This dataset has been provided to you in parquet format at path ``~/public/pa2d_dev``In the first section, you will use the ``read_parquet`` method to read your parquet dataset into a  Ray.data.Dataset object. Ray Data uses Ray Tasks to read files in parallel. [This](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/data-internals.html) is a useful resource to understand how data loading works.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prereq: place the data in `private` \n",
    "For the `ray-notebook` server, JupyterHub runs on the head node, with worker nodes having access only to the `private` folder. Thus, you will need to copy over the dataset to your `private` folder as: \n",

I had to go back and reread it as soon as I finished it because it is so rich in historical and psychological  details, particularly themes centering on painful family dynamics and history.\\n\\nPotential readers of this novel by Claire Messud should know it isn't exactly a sunny, bouncy work. If you are looking for that you'll want to look elsewhere. It also moves between countries, including sections based in France, the U.S. and Algeria.\\n\\nThe focus of the novel is the LaBasse family and the story is told from the viewpoint of Sagesse, a woman who conveys the weight of a turbulent family history. Starting with Sagesse's grandfather, a man who owns the Hotel Bellevue in France,the family dynamics begin to play themselves out, connecting to larger themes of France and Algeria's history as well, with stunning consequences.\\n\\nSagesse's parents, Alex and Carol, reveal plenty about the kind of problems that can arise when there are cross-cultural challenges to face in a marriage. Carol, coming from America, marries Alex, but is unable to see the potential sacrifices and problems she'll face as she moves overseas to live with her husband...or the impact the marriage will have on her daughter and the rest of the family, including a handicapped son.\\n\\n It is a bit hard to categorize this book because it covers so many areas. It is part mystery because Sagesse is trying to separate truth from myth when figuring out her family's history. It is part suspense because of Sagesse's short love affair and a moment of violence (and I don't want to give the details of that moment or I'll spoil it for you). It is also a historical novel, rich with information about events in Algeria and France and the United States.\\n\\nFor me, also, this one centers on themes of personal identity and displacement,primarily for Sagesse, a woman trying to figure out where she belongs in the world and how to make peace with her difficult family as well as coming to grips with history's impact on her family.\",\n",

This incredible novel contains  various elements of fiction: historical, philosophical, and just the right  touch of magical realism.\\nThe story is about a French-Algerian family  and the constant moving to different parts of the world -- the South of  France, the East Coast of the U.S. and Algeria -- has affected each of  their lives. It seems as though each family member has found his or her  identity in one of the many places they have been. As a result, they never  feel like they have found a home. The thing that struck me most when  reading this book was how the author described life in the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's. The historical part of the novel is  incredibly accurate. Let me tell you that I have learned a lot of important  parts of history in this book. I also love the fact that the story is told  through the eyes of fourteen-year-old Lagesse, seen through the eyes of  innocence indeed!  The Last Life is -- without a  stretch of doubt -- the best historical fiction novel I have ever read.  This novel should not be overlooked. Run along and get it!\",\n",

And who\\'s moving - in any sense - in this novel?  Where\\'s the \"bildung?\"  The denouement?  The dsillusionner?  I must have  skimmed the wrong paragraph.\\nI do agree that parts of the novel are very  engaging.  They are.  And, like some other readers, I did enjoy the events  in Algeria.  This is the strongest part of the novel, perhaps because it is  not so deeply stuck in the protagonist\\'s life that had the unfortunate  knack of boring me in the first-person!  (Yeah, that\\'s what I mean.)  Overall, the novel is just a bit overdone.  I prefer a bildungsroman - if  that\\'s what this should be - to show me a growth, not tell me all about the  all-too-interesting things that happened along the way.\\nIf you\\'re the  kind of person who can sit for hours and listen to a friend tell you  endless stories about herself that you can\\'t help but suspect are just a  tad trumped up, then you might really dig into this novel.  Otherwise you  might have an experience more like mine which was one of detached interest.

       "  'reviewText': 'I purchased and installed this unit in a 2007 Honda Pilot EX-L with Navigation.  So far after a day it seems to work well.  Able to either control the iPod (Touch and Nano) from my radio while showing song info, or have the iPod just output directly in Auxiliary mode.  Unit charges my iPod as well, since it is running through the iPod connector, so don\\'t need to worry about running out of batteries on a long trip, or using a power adapter.  Auxiliary input via 3.5mm plug also works as advertised (for other MP3 players).\\n\\nPlan for a half day to a day to perform the installation.  The main issues that took time for me to figure out were (1) taking apart the center stack to get to the rear of the radio - for which I checked out on-line forums, (2) didn\\'t realize that switching from XM to iPod mode you have to switch to AM/FM, then XM, then turn the tuner dial *immediately* to go to iPod mode (I wasn\\'t doing it fast enough, but called technical support on a Saturday and the specialist helped me immediately, no waiting on hold - terrific!), and (3) routing the cables to the unit.\\n\\nI installed mine behind the glovebox so that I can access it easily for firmware upgrades without taking apart the center stack again - seems like the vendor supplies them regularly to support new iPod OS upgrades.  You use a mini-USB cable to do this, and their software supports XP and Vista.\\n\\nThe instructions supplied, although adequate, didn\\'t seem as detailed and \"cohesive\" as could be.  There were a couple of pieces of paper with slightly different instructions - no doubt supplied to try and avoid issues without reprinting the owners manual.  Also, no vehicle-specific instructions, so check on-line to see if anyone else has done it for your car and posted their experience.\\n\\nAlso, if possible, check if your seller has the unit with the latest iPod cable that supports iPhone 3G (5v charging).  My unit arrived with a sticker on the box stating \"Now charges iPhone 3G, iPod Touch Gen 2, iPod Nano Gen4\"; otherwise you *might* need to buy another cable that supports these newer devices.  The cable is backwards compatible with older iPods, so you might as well get the latest if possible.\\n\\nThere are a few odd-ball things to get used to, I assume since this a generic unit meant to work with many cars.  One, the units lets you reverse a song by pressing one of the present buttons, but on the Honda radio this button is also labelled fast forward (for the CD player).  Also, the radio interface will never be as easy to use as an iPod interface; those with nice LCD navigation screens will not see an \"iPod\" interface, just the song info.',\n",

There are a lot of ipod integration accessories on the market, but i really wanted one that was completely integrated and didn't stick out like a sore thumb on the dash somewhere coming out of the lighter socket.  I also wanted digital sound and don't like the FM transmitters or tape adapters.  This unit takes control of the XM function of the factory radio without eliminating XM which is nice for anyone that subscribes to XM.  I like the fact that it is easy to use, using only the radio controls and that i get display of music on the factory radio.  I recognize that the radio I have is the limiting factor in things that I would like (e.g. scrolling of the song name).\\n\\nI gave it four stars for two reasons:\\n\\n1) when going through artists, it's a one click at a time of the knob, not a fast spin through artist to get to the letter S as an example.  To circumvent this, plan ahead and make sure you have playlists, they are easier to navigate.\\n\\n2) sometime the display will not show the song artist in the display. pressing the xm button once, will bring it up. this is a minor inconvenience and doesn't ruin the experience.\\n\\nAll in all, high quality item so far in the 4 months I've used it and would recommend it. no issues with playback, no dropped songs, no crackle.  I also installed the HD tuner as well and it's pretty good too.\",\n",

The picture is crisp, intelligent sensor works great, and I have no complaints at all. I love the size and clarity as well as the remote choices. The controls are intuitive and it is easy to set up and start. It's also one of the nicest looking televisions out there, in my opinion. It does swivel, and the sound is adequate also.

I recommend this TV!\\n\\nThe Good Features\\n\\nThe speakers are good (no hiss or low quality digital sound). The speakers are hidden below the TV. So it\\'s good for confined spaces. They\\'re not as good as a $500 surround sound system with a sub-woofer, but you get what you pay for.\\n\\nIt has an option to turn off the TV power LED when it is not on, which is helpful if you sleep in the room with the TV. The LED also flashes when it receives a command from the remote control, which is good feedback when you don\\'t notice something is blocking the remote control signal to the TV, like the edge of a TV stand. When the TV is off, the red LED looks like HAL 9000 from the movie 2001, which I got a kick out of.\\n\\nI like the swivel stand on the TV, which is good for easier cable setup. It\\'s Energy Star compliant. It has a great user interface for adding and removing TV channels after you have automatically scanned all the channels (tabbed panels with a preview pane). It can handle HDTV (ATSC) and analog TV (NTSC) signals.\\n\\nThe picture quality is much better than my previous LCD TV. I have no complaints when it\\'s viewed from a typical viewing angle.\\n\\nThe Bad Features\\n\\nEven though it has great side to side viewing angle, it has a slightly worse than average viewing angle from the bottom. So when mounting this TV up high, you should consider wall mounting it with a downward tilt. Viewing from 45 degrees from below washes out the colors, but this viewing angle isn\\'t typical for most people.\\n\\nThe reflection from the border on the TV can be distracting in a room with a lot of lights when displaying a show with very low light levels (e.g. a horror movie typically has very low light levels). The border also shows dust a little more easily than a matte finish. It\\'s a nice and shiny TV though.',\n",

The Autofill function is awesome, and perfect for what the Shuffle is. I didn't want to take my 40 Gig to the gym for fear of dropping it... the shuffle is fantastic for that.

       "  'reviewText': \"As a compact, flash-based mp3 player, the shuffle fills a niche in the market.\\n\\nApple's greatest contribution to the mp3 player market was the aesthetics of their players: love it or hate it, you have to admit that the iPod looks unique, and most people (like me) will go as far as saying it looks pretty good.  Before everyone and their neighbor's dog owned one, you could pull out an iPod and make the room stop.\\n\\nThe shuffle continues this tradition.  Apple's sleek, simple design hides a fairly powerful little flash-based player.  It's tiny (although not the smallest player on the market, despite what their ad people may say), feather-light and on the whole, very trendy looking.  The 512 memory is just about the right size for what I suspect is the primary target market for these players: people looking for a small, durable alternative to their iPod for short trips, work-outs, etc.\\n\\nOther pros:\\n\\n-Simple, intuitive control interface\\n\\n-Easy to interface with pretty much any machine\\n\\n-iPod users can use all their .AAC format music\\n\\n-No, seriously, this thing weighs next to nothing.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n-No external LCD.  Apple had to sacrifice SOMEthing to make this product as small and lightweight as it is, and the LCD screen is the first of these things.  While not a problem for those intimately familiar with their music collection or those not picky about what they listen to, many users will definitely not appreciate the inability to easily navigate the songs contained on the player.\\n\\n-Terrible battery life.  Much like the iPod compared to its competitors (e.g. the Zen Touch), the Shuffle has less than 2/3 the average battery life of comparable features (meaning with no LCD screens).  Again, Apple had to sacrifice something in order to make the product as lightweight and small as it is, and this shouldn't be a problem for the majority of users, as the shuffle seems to be geared toward short trips.\\n\\n-Like the iPod, you must interface the Shuffle with iTunes.  Now before the pro-iPod army comes and kills me, let me explain: I have nothing against iTunes, it's a great program (as evidenced by Microsoft blatantly copying it with Media Player 10), but I personally despise being forced to use any one application with my hardware.  If Apple had made the Shuffle drag'n'drop compatible, it would have been a much better purchase.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"This is an amazingly small version of an Ipod that can hold a fair amount of music (about 8-10 CDS or so)  and play it back with the really great sound that Apple's much pricier Ipod players have.  The great thing about an Ipod is that you can essentially load your CDs onto it though Apple's Itunes software and then use your Ipod to access the CDs or lists of songs you create from these CDs on your computer.  The negative of  the Shuffle player  is that you basically load  a batch of CDs or lists of songs from your computer and  have pretty limited control on how you access them - either just shuffling though them on a random basis or skipping through them in order.  Is this a bad thing?  It depends on what you want.  If it is a chance  to have a good batch of songs to play through without a lot of need to select specific songs, it is great -- kind of like a super radio station that can play selections  you want to hear, either randomly or in some basic order.  If you want to create a music library in your pocket to easily select from a mix of songs, the Shuffle doesn't work well.\\n\\n The unit is great when you want a mix of music (say for a plane trip or for a week of daily runs) or a program in a certain order (say a talking book).  The unit is incredibly easy to load up (just plug into the USB port of your computer -- also charges here) and Itunes software is a cinch to use to import music from CDs (or purchase music files from Apple).\\n\\nGiven the price, it is (by the standards of Ipods) a good deal as a way of getting great sounding music in a small unit.  It presents a nice alternative to a heavier and much more expensive Ipod  -- good things as long as you accept its limitations.\",\n",
